## Magnetic Resonance Elastography

**Project description:**  The advent of new MRI imaging techniques necessitates the development of precise actuators for tissue interrogation. The development of magnetic resonance elastography (MRE) enabled clinicians to diagnose and track the progression of liver fibrosis via MRI mitigating the need for invasive biopsy procedures. Although the ability to non-invasively image tissue properties produced a paradigm shift in liver disease treatment, adaptation of the technique to other diseases was stymied by the lack of available actuation modalities. Significant advancements in the design of MRE actuators are necessary to both improve efficacy and enable use in stiffer target tissues, such as the intervetebral discs. Additionally, current MRE drivers are statically positioned, and the development of a system for active driver positioning is of particular benefit to higher frequency applications.  

This work focused on the development of high frequency, tunable resonance, actuators for Magnetic Resonance Elastography. Piezoelectric shell actuators were designed around a target frequency range, along with a 5 DOF positioing system.
