## Tendon reflex stimulation for precise neuromodulation

This work focused on the development of tools for investigation and intervention in the human nervous system. Primary focus was the sensorimotor response to peripheral stimulation. 
I developed a precise stimulation device, along with sensing and analysis methods for stimulation intensity measurment. I also used these tools to work on LSTM based prediction of the somatosesory response to peripheral stimulations of varied intensity.
